This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying GoCommander v1.0.4 to production.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Validation

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure you're on the main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Verify Node.js version (14+ required)
node --version

go version

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Build and Test
```bash
# Clean previous builds
npm run clean

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run comprehensive tests
npm run test:ci

# Validate release readiness
npm run validate:release
```

### 3. Final Validation
```bash
# Run final release preparation
npm run release:final
```

## üì¶ NPM Publication

### 1. Pre-Publication Checks
```bash
# Verify package contents
npm pack --dry-run

# Check package size (should show compressed size)
npm pack
ls -la *.tgz
rm *.tgz

# Verify package.json configuration
cat package.json | jq '.version, .main, .module, .types, .exports'
```

### 2. Publish to NPM
```bash
# Login to npm (if not already logged in)
npm login

# Verify npm user
npm whoami

# Publish the package
npm publish

# Verify publication
npm view gocommander@1.0.4
```

### 3. Post-Publication Verification
```bash
# Test installation in a clean directory
mkdir test-install && cd test-install
npm init -y
npm install gocommander@1.0.4

# Test basic functionality
node -e "const {program} = require('gocommander'); console.log('GoCommander loaded successfully');"

# Clean up
cd .. && rm -rf test-install
```

## üè∑Ô∏è GitHub Release

### 1. Create Git Tag
```bash
# Create and push the release tag
git tag v1.0.4
git push origin v1.0.4
```

### 2. Create GitHub Release
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI (recommended)
gh release create v1.0.4 \
  --title "GoCommander v1.0.4 - Production Ready" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.4.md \
  --latest

# Or manually through GitHub web interface:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/rohitsoni007/gocommander/releases
# 2. Click "Create a new release"
# 3. Choose tag v1.0.4
# 4. Set title: "GoCommander v1.0.4 - Production Ready"
# 5. Copy content from RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.4.md
# 6. Mark as "Latest release"
# 7. Publish release
```

### 3. Upload Release Assets
```bash
# Build release assets
npm run build
tar -czf gocommander-v1.0.4-assets.tar.gz lib/ wasm/ docs/ examples/

# Upload to GitHub release (if using CLI)
gh release upload v1.0.4 gocommander-v1.0.4-assets.tar.gz
```

## üìö Documentation Deployment

### 1. Update Documentation Sites
```bash
# If you have a documentation site, update it with v1.0.4 docs
# Example for GitHub Pages:
git checkout gh-pages
cp -r docs/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Update documentation for v1.0.4"
git push origin gh-pages
git checkout main
```

### 2. Update README Badges
Ensure README.md has current version badges:
```markdown
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/gocommander.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/gocommander)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/gocommander.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gocommander)
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Monitoring

### 1. NPM Package Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor download stats
npm view gocommander

# Check for issues
npm audit

# Monitor package size
npm pack --dry-run
```

### 2. GitHub Monitoring
- Monitor GitHub Issues for bug reports
- Watch GitHub Discussions for community feedback
- Track GitHub Stars and Forks for adoption metrics
- Monitor Pull Requests for community contributions

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
npm run benchmark

# Monitor for performance regressions
npm run test:performance
```

## üö® Rollback Procedures

### 1. NPM Rollback
```bash
# If critical issues are found, deprecate the version
npm deprecate gocommander@1.0.4 "Critical issue found, use v1.0.3 instead"

# Or unpublish within 24 hours (not recommended for production)
npm unpublish gocommander@1.0.4
```

### 2. GitHub Rollback
```bash
# Mark release as pre-release if issues found
gh release edit v1.0.4 --prerelease

# Or delete the release
gh release delete v1.0.4
git tag -d v1.0.4
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.4
```
